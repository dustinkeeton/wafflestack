# Report a toolkit problem upstream

Wraps `wafflestack report` — the read-only subcommand that prints a **redacted** diagnostics block
(lock, config **keys**, doctor summary, environment) — and files the result as an issue in the
**toolkit's** tracker. This is the distinction from `/issue`: `/issue` files into the repo you are
standing in; a broken render, an `upgrade` that moved a pin and went red, or a skill whose prompt
contradicts its docs is a **wafflestack defect**, and it belongs upstream, where the maintainer can
act on it.

Two things make an upstream report useful, and this skill owns both:

- **Diagnostics.** The facts a maintainer needs to triage — toolkit version, source/ref/commit,
  targets, stacks, what `doctor` says, node and platform — are collected by the CLI, not narrated
  from memory.
- **Redaction.** The target repo is **public** and you do not own it. Absolute paths (which carry
  the OS username), remote URLs, emails, config **values**, and above all the gitignored private
  overlay must never leave this machine. The CLI redacts by construction; you finish the job on the
  prose, and the user approves the **post-redaction** bytes.

## Mode and flags

**Strip `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` from `$ARGUMENTS` first** — only as an unquoted flag token in the **first or last**
position; a `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` mid-prose or in backticks is description text, reaches the draft, and the gate
still fires. What remains is the description. An empty description is not an error: ask one
question ("what went wrong?") and continue with the answer.

Same convention as `/issue`, `/pr-response`, and `/clean-up`: the gate is a `*.confirmGate`
config key — here `waffle.reportConfirmGate` — and `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` is its declared `flag:` token,
rendered from the stack. It skips the confirmation gate for one run, beats the config value, and is
for an agent calling this skill or a user who has said "no need to confirm". In interactive use, do
not pass it unless asked. There is no on-token: nothing here needs to force a gate that is on by
default.

**Rendered gate for this repo: `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate}}`** — the value after `.waffle/waffle.local.yaml` →
`.waffle/waffle.yaml` → the stack default (`true`). With no token:

| `waffle.reportConfirmGate` | Human-attended run | Non-interactive caller (CI, a subagent with no human on its turn) |
|---|---|---|
| `true` | Gate: show the redacted payload, wait for a yes. | **Fail** — the key's `nonInteractive: fail`: say that nothing was filed and hand back the draft. |
| `false` | No gate: proceed as if `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` were passed. | File. |
| `prompt` | Assume nothing: ask, which for a gate means gating exactly as `true` does. | **Fail** — the same `nonInteractive: fail`. |

This is the one `*.confirmGate` gate in the toolkit with **no** non-interactive skip: the report
lands in a public repo you do not own, so it is never filed silently. A caller with nobody to ask
either passes `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` (an explicit consent) or gets nothing filed. A consumer changes the default
in config, never by editing this rendered file.

## Plan first, then act

1. **Plan phase — read-only.** Run the CLI, classify, draft, redact. Nothing on GitHub changes.
2. **Act phase — mutating.** Exactly one call: `gh issue create`. It runs only after the gate.

Declining the gate leaves GitHub untouched; there is nothing to roll back.

### 1. Collect the diagnostics

```bash
npx --yes {{waffle.toolkitRef}} report
```

It prints a collapsed `<details>` block and exits 0 **even when doctor is red** — a red doctor is
the report's subject, not a reason to stop. It reads the committed config and lock only: the
`.waffle/waffle.local.yaml` overlay and `.waffle/waffle.local.lock.json` are never opened, config
values are withheld (key paths are listed), and `cwd` → `<repo>`, home → `~`, emails and git
remotes → placeholders. Capture the block verbatim; it goes at the end of the body.

If the problem is a failing command, run it once more and keep the **last 30 lines** of its
output for the Context section — after redacting them yourself (step 4). Do not re-run a
**writing** command (`render`, `install`, `upgrade`, `reinstall`, `uninstall`) just to capture
output; use what the user already has, or `doctor`.

### 2. Resolve the target repo

The toolkit this repo runs is `{{waffle.toolkitRef}}`. Take the `OWNER/REPO` inside a
`github:OWNER/REPO[#ref]` spec — that is where the report goes, so a fork's consumer reports to
the fork. If the spec is not `github:`-shaped (a local checkout path), use the lock's
`toolkit.source` from the diagnostics block (`source github:OWNER/REPO`); if that is null too, fall
back to `dustinkeeton/wafflestack`. State the resolved target at the gate.

### 3. Classify and draft

Match the upstream issue forms exactly — a skill-filed report and a hand-filed one must converge on
one shape, so the maintainer's enrichment pass can pick either straight off the queue:

| Report is | Upstream form | Label to apply | Body sections |
|---|---|---|---|
| a defect, regression, or behavior that contradicts the docs | `bug.yml` | `bug` | Problem / Motivation (Expected / Actual / Repro), Proposed Solution (optional), Context |
| a missing capability or a change to how something works | `feature.yml` | `enhancement` | Problem / Motivation, Proposed Solution, Sub-issues (optional), Context |
| a half-formed one-liner — the user could not or did not say more | `rough-idea.yml` | `waffle:needs-inference` | The idea (the user's words, **verbatim**), Context |

Route honestly: a one-liner is a **rough idea**, not a bug you invent details for. The
`waffle:needs-inference` label is the enrichment queue — filing there is the low-friction path, and
padding a one-liner into a fake bug report defeats it.

Apply **only the form's own label**. Never apply a `priority: *` label (that is the maintainer's
triage call), never touch the upstream project board or milestones, and never guess at labels
beyond the three above.

Draft with `##` headings matching the form field labels, a title under 70 characters, and the
diagnostics block appended under the last section:

```markdown
## Problem / Motivation
Expected: …
Actual: …
Repro: the exact command, and the last lines of its output

## Proposed Solution
(omit if none)

## Context
<the collapsed <details> block from step 1, verbatim>
```

### 4. Redact — the named deny-list

The CLI already scrubbed its own output. Apply the same deny-list to **everything else** in the
draft — the user's prose, pasted command output, file names:

- **Never read** `.waffle/waffle.local.yaml` or `.waffle/waffle.local.lock.json`. Not to "check
  what is in there", not to explain a value. Their purpose is to not propagate.
- **Absolute paths** → repo-relative, or `~/…` when outside the repo. `/Users/<name>/…` and
  `/home/<name>/…` carry the OS username.
- **Git remotes, org/repo names, and remote URLs** of *this* repo → `<git-remote>` /
  `<org>/<repo>`. The toolkit's own `github:OWNER/REPO` spec is the report's destination and stays.
- **Email addresses** (authors, bots) → `<email>`.
- **Config values** → dropped. Keep the **key** (`git.botEmail is set` is the diagnostic
  signal; the value is the consumer's). Tokens, hostnames, and anything that looks like a
  credential are values.

Re-read the whole draft once after redacting. What you show at the gate is what gets published.

### 5. Confirm — the gate

Present, and gate on an explicit yes:

- **Target**: `OWNER/REPO` (and how it was resolved)
- **Form / label**: `bug.yml` → `bug`, etc.
- **Title**
- **The full body, post-redaction** — the exact bytes, not a summary or a promise about them

On a decline, stop. Skipped by `{{waffle.reportConfirmGate.flag.off}}` or a rendered gate of `false` — never by being non-interactive.

### 6. File it

Write the approved body to a file (never an inline `--body` and never a heredoc), then:

```bash
gh issue create --repo OWNER/REPO --title "<title>" --body-file "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/waffle-report-<slug>.md" --label "<label>"
```

Gate on the **exit status**, not the output. On success, report the issue URL.

**If it fails** — no `gh` auth, no access to the toolkit repo, or the label does not exist there —
**say plainly that nothing was submitted**, then hand the user the one-paste path:

1. Print the finished title and body.
2. Print a prefilled new-issue URL that selects the form and fills its fields by their ids —
   issue *forms* ignore a `body=` parameter, so prefill the field ids instead: `problem`,
   `solution`, `context` for `bug.yml` / `feature.yml`; `idea`, `context` for `rough-idea.yml`;
   plus `title`. URL-encode each value:

   ```text
   https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/new?template=bug.yml&title=<title>&problem=<…>&context=<…>
   ```

   Browsers and GitHub cap URL length around 8 KB; if the body would exceed that, give the
   `template` + `title` URL and tell the user to paste the printed sections in.

Do not retry with a different account, a different repo, or by dropping the redaction.
