# AGENTS.md — wafflestack

Canonical, harness-neutral agent/skill definitions grouped into stacks; the `wafflestack`
CLI renders them into harness-native files (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`) inside a
consuming project. Rendered files are generated output — edit source (`stacks/**`,
`schema/**`, `installer/**`), project config, or a project extension, never the rendered files.

Entry points: `installer/cli.mjs` (bin `wafflestack`) · `toolkit.yaml` (stack registry) ·
`schema/FORMAT.md` (format reference).

## Stack registry

`toolkit.yaml` lists 9 stacks (14 agents + 32 skills; reorganized in #38 — `design`
dissolved, roles consolidated, `security-audit` variants renamed). Per-stack config schema,
env, prerequisites, and setup notes live in each `stack.yaml` (authoritative — this table summarizes).

| Stack | Path | Agents | Skills | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|--------|---------|
| `docs-system` | `stacks/docs-system/` | docs-agent, docs-human | docs-agent, docs-human | Two-audience doc system; doc-set shapes (`docs.machineDocSet/Spec`, `docs.humanDocSet/Spec`) are config. |
| `github-workflow` | `stacks/github-workflow/` | (none) | git-workflow, issue, github-project-management, github-project-board, clean-up, label-hook, hygiene, release | Git / GitHub issue / Projects v2 / release workflow. `github-project-management` reads/updates board items; `github-project-board` (#54) provisions/standardizes the board itself to the canonical Kanban spec (Status/Priority/Size/Start/Target; Table/Kanban/Roadmap views) — the only create-side board skill. Ships seven prefab CI workflows as `files/` (syrup) payloads: `waffle-doctor` (read-only drift gate, default render) plus six **opt-in syrup** hooks — `waffle-label-hook` (label→enrich/implement Claude dispatch), `waffle-hygiene` (daily scheduled `docs`→auto-merge PR), `waffle-release-hook` (deterministic tag-on-merge, `contents: write`, no Claude), `waffle-post-merge-hook` (deterministic remote merged-head-branch delete, `contents: write`, pairs with `clean-up`), `waffle-evals` (nightly Layer-2 LLM eval runner, `node installer/evals.mjs`, no Claude dispatch), and `waffle-pr-green-hook` (#112/#180 — on a PR's checks going green, dispatch the harness to run `adversarial-review` and post one hostile pre-merge review; deduped per green head by a `<!-- waffle-adversarial-review -->` marker) — each wired to its companion skill/waffle via a `files/`-keyed `requires:` edge. Declares typed `prerequisites:` (tool probes `require`; secrets/scopes/labels/settings/services `recommend`). Config: `labelHook.*`, `hygiene.{cron,claudeArgs}`, `release.{tagFormat,versionFiles}`, `prGreen.{watchWorkflows,claudeArgs}`, `evals.{cron,maxCalls,model}`, `autoMerge.label` (`waffle-auto-merged`, #134). Only stack with a `setup:` block (gh auth, labels, board, git identity, hook opt-ins). |
| `code-quality` | `stacks/code-quality/` | (none) | tdd, codebase-architecture, adversarial-review, qa, dry | Cross-cutting, project-agnostic practice skills (#117; test command, tiers, module map, settings type are config). `adversarial-review` (#112) is a config-free `/adversarial-review <PR#>` hostile post-green PR review (reads `gh pr diff`, posts a severity-tagged review); auto-triggered by the github-workflow `waffle-pr-green-hook` syrup (#180). `qa` (#228) is its functional sibling — `/qa <PR#>` checks a green PR against the linked issue's intent/acceptance criteria, best-effort runs `project.testCmd` and assesses diff test coverage, posts one review under its own `<!-- waffle-qa -->` marker (distinct from adversarial-review's, so pr-green/pr-response automation never cross-fires); report-only, composed by autopilot's opt-in QA gate (`autopilot.qaLoop`). `dry` (#116) is de-duplication under the rule-of-three + semantic-sameness guardrails. |
| `obsidian-dev` | `stacks/obsidian-dev/` | plugin-architect | obsidian-plugin-dev, electron-security-audit | Obsidian plugin development (API, manifest, esbuild, testing patterns) + the desktop-app security-audit variant; plugin-architect is the domain architect. |
| `orchestration` | `stacks/orchestration/` | project-manager, product-manager, task-planner | delegate, autopilot, audit, docs, standup | Multi-agent orchestration; sets env `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. Roster + audit compliance are config (defaults: `lead-engineer` architect + compliance, `security-engineer` security; override compliance to a domain architect where one exists). Uses `requires:` for its skill deps (delegate→git-workflow+github-project-management+github-project-board, docs→docs-agent+docs-human). `delegate` ships three dependency-free supporting files (copied with the skill): `checkpoint.mjs` + `checkpoint.schema.json` (#105/#106) validate the one-JSON-doc-per-run phase checkpoint at every phase boundary (`node checkpoint.mjs --file F --phase fetch\|classify\|plan\|execute\|report`; schema sections per phase plus cross-reference checks — executed branch = planned branch, every issue traces to fetch, parallel⇒worktree/serial⇒none; exit 1 = STOP); `memory.mjs` (#107) gates the curated per-repo run-memory doc (`node memory.mjs --file F [--max-bytes N]`; missing file valid; hard byte cap + required Why/Since/Area fields per entry; exit 1 = curate, never truncate — memory loads in Classify, informs Plan grouping, injects Area-matched entries into agent prompts, is curated in Report). Opt-in approval gate (`delegate.approveBeforePush`): agents commit locally and STOP before `git push`/`gh pr create`; orchestrator collects human approval via AskUserQuestion; rejection stays local, recorded `skipped` with `approval`/`approvedBy` in the checkpoint. Config: `delegate.{defaultScope,extraPreflight,checkpointDir,approveBeforePush,autoMerge,batchMode,memoryFile,memoryMaxBytes}` — `defaultScope` is `current-milestone`\|`all-open`\|`todo-column` (#206: `todo-column` delegates exactly the board's Status="Todo" open issues via the github-project-management GraphQL catalog; missing board/Todo option falls back to `all-open` explicitly — checkpoint records `mode: "all-open"` with provenance in `description` — while an empty Todo column stops instead of widening and a FAILED board lookup (API error/missing scope) stops rather than falling back); `checkpointDir`/`memoryFile` defaults are themselves placeholders (`{{git.worktreesDir}}/.delegate`, `{{delegate.checkpointDir}}/memory.md`), exercising depth-4 nested expansion. Two batch/autopilot opt-ins: `delegate.autoMerge` (#98/#141, default false — after `gh pr create`, arm `gh pr merge --auto --merge` so the PR merges itself once the base branch's required checks pass; arm-only-on-a-required-check, never an immediate or `--admin` merge; per-run, records `autoMergeArmed` per PR) and `delegate.batchMode` (#99/#142, default false — non-interactive: explicit scope stands in for the Phase-3 plan-approval gate and an ambiguous classification falls back to serial-in-main; composes with `autoMerge`, never weakens the `approveBeforePush` pre-push gate). `autopilot` (#100/#143) is the unattended backlog runner — a prose playbook that composes `delegate` (with `batchMode` + the run's `autoMerge` engaged), `clean-up`, and `git-workflow` into a per-issue **plan→implement→PR** loop over a REQUIRED issue scope, re-implementing none of that machinery. Instantiation contract, captured before any work: (1) an explicit issue **scope** — an issue list, `milestone:<name>`, a label, or `all-open` — which is also what activates delegate's batch mode, so a run is never unscoped; and (2) per-run auto-merge **consent** (`autopilot.autoMerge`, default false, captured fresh each run, **never sticky** — never read back from a prior run/checkpoint/memory). Per issue: one read-only planning context writes `{{autopilot.planDir}}/issue-<N>.md`, injected into a fresh delegate-spawned implementer as a *brief, not a contract*; delegate opens the PR; on consent each PR self-arms on green, else it is left for human review; per merged PR autopilot runs post-merge housekeeping (verify the issue closed, board→Done, `clean-up git --yes`). Guardrails inherited verbatim from `hygiene`/`delegate.autoMerge`: never push `main`, never `--admin`-merge, merge-commits-not-squash, one retry then stop-and-report, a blocked serial chain stops its dependents. Three further opt-in, per-run gates run between PR verification and the merge-wait, in fixed pipeline order — the QA gate (#228: `qa <PR#>` → `pr-response <PR#> --yes` rounds, functional QA against the linked issue's intent, `autopilot.qaLoop` consent / `+qa`, capped per run at `+qa:N` else the `autopilot.maxQaRounds` default — #230), the review loop (#220: `adversarial-review` → `pr-response` rounds, `autopilot.reviewLoop` / `+review`, capped per run at `+review:N` else the `autopilot.maxReviewRounds` default — #230), and the diff-scoped `/audit` gate (#221: `autopilot.auditStep` / `+audit`, hard-blocks on unresolved Critical/High) — with auto-merge arming deferred to the last enabled gate, convergence read as a 0-implemented round, and a can't-converge cap filing an `autopilot.holdLabel` (`waffle-manual-review`) follow-up that automatic scope thereafter skips. `requires:` `delegate` + `clean-up` + `git-workflow` + `github-project-management` + `qa` + `adversarial-review` + `pr-response` + `audit` + `issue`. Config: `autopilot.{autoMerge,planDir,qaLoop,maxQaRounds,reviewLoop,maxReviewRounds,auditStep,holdLabel}` (`planDir` default `{{git.worktreesDir}}/.autopilot` — gitignored throwaway plan files). `standup` rounds up a per-agent status pulse — dynamic `.claude/agents/*.md` roster, one read-only parallel wave, collect-via-return-values, no side effects. |
| `engineering-team` | `stacks/engineering-team/` | lead-engineer, data-engineer, qa-engineer, devops-engineer, ux-designer, security-engineer | webapp-security-audit | Product-eng roster (browser-app security variant); lead-engineer is the general architect. Slots into `orchestration`'s roster. |
| `expo-dev` | `stacks/expo-dev/` | mobile-architect | expo-ui, expo-app-dev | Expo / React Native app development (@expo/ui, dev loop, EAS); mobile-architect is the domain architect. |
| `harness-architect` | `stacks/harness-architect/` | harness-architect | (none) | Single domain agent — expert in building agent harnesses (agent/skill/tool decomposition, subagent teams, hooks, MCP, slash-command UX, multi-harness portability). One optional config key (`project.longName`). This repo appends a project extension grounding it in the stack's own paradigms (AGENTS.md registry, schema/FORMAT.md contract, DECISIONS.md ADRs, validation gates). |
| `wafflestack` | `stacks/wafflestack/` | (none) | waffle-init, waffle-setup, waffle-install, waffle-render, waffle-upgrade, waffle-doctor, waffle-eject, waffle-validate | Self-referential stack (#70): one user-invocable `/waffle-*` skill per CLI subcommand, each a thin wrapper that shells out to `npx <waffle.toolkitRef> <sub>` and interprets the output with agent judgment (e.g. `/waffle-upgrade` reviews the render diff, `/waffle-eject` confirms before releasing a file). Dogfoods the toolkit's own delivery mechanism. One optional config key (`waffle.toolkitRef`, default `github:dustinkeeton/wafflestack` — pin to a tag or a local checkout). Enabled in this repo's own render (dogfooded). |

Architect seniority rule (#38): `lead-engineer` is the general architect; `plugin-architect`
and `mobile-architect` take seniority in their domains. The former `security-audit` name
collision is resolved by the `electron-`/`webapp-` renames; the output-conflict guard
(`render.mjs:100`) still errors if two enabled stacks ever emit the same path.

## Installer module registry

`installer/lib/*.mjs`, ES modules. See signatures block below for exports.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `installer/lib/render.mjs` | Render pipeline: resolve external sources (`loadToolkitWithSources`), validate external stacks pre-write (#126), compute selection, regenerate all outputs verbatim, delete stale managed files, write lock (+ per-source `sources` provenance, #125). Output-conflict + scoped required-config + env/prerequisite render-warnings (cheap `tool`/`env` probes only) + unmanaged-file overwrite guard (refuses to clobber a pre-existing untracked file unless `force`; `render.mjs:245`) + external opt-in-syrup trust-boundary warnings. Passes the prior lock's file paths to `computeSelection` as `trackedFiles` so already-installed opt-in syrup keeps rendering. |
| `installer/lib/refs.mjs` | Ref grammar, toolkit-wide resolution, transitive cross-stack dependency closure + render-selection computation, and `itemOutputMatcher(kind,name)` (item→lock-path predicate, shared with eject/list). Pure leaf (no local imports). Shared by install / render / validate / eject / list. |
| `installer/lib/template.mjs` | `{{placeholder}}` substitution: declared-key gate, per-target resolve, depth-capped nested expansion, value formatting, optional per-key `pattern:` value validation. |
| `installer/lib/toolkit.mjs` | Load `toolkit.yaml` + every stack manifest (agents, skills, `files` payloads with sniffed `binary` flag, `optIn` opt-in set, `requires`, `prerequisites`, config, env, setup); scoped required-key check. `loadToolkitWithSources` (#88) additionally resolves each external `source:` entry to a toolkit root and merges its named stack (with `provenance`) into one registry; a cross-source stack-name collision is a hard error naming both. |
| `installer/lib/project.mjs` | Load consuming-project config (+ local overlay), valid targets, `harness.*` built-ins (incl. CI-dispatcher `action*` keys + their injection-guard patterns, #131), per-target resolver; parse/validate `stacks:` bare names vs `{name,source,ref}` external entries (#88); multi-generation legacy-name read fallback + in-place dotfile migration chain (`.wafflestack.*` → `.waffle.*` → `.waffle/waffle.*`). |
| `installer/lib/util.mjs` | Shared helpers: sha256, YAML read, deep-merge, dotted lookup, frontmatter parse/stringify, fs writes, semver parse/compare. |
| `installer/lib/doctor.mjs` | Diff managed files against the lock; always report the rendered `toolkitVersion` + a skew note pointing at `upgrade`. Attributes each drifted external file to its source (#125). Runs the selected stacks' typed `prerequisites:` checks (#129): an unmet `require` fails doctor (exit 1), `recommend` only reports; best-effort (a load failure is a note, not a break). |
| `installer/lib/eject.mjs` | `eject` (release an item, self-cleaning its `include:`), `installRefs` (persist stack/item refs to config), `init` (starter config). |
| `installer/lib/validate.mjs` | Toolkit-developer lint: manifests, frontmatter, placeholder↔declaration sync, agent-skill + `requires:` ref integrity, config `pattern:` compilability + default-match. |
| `installer/lib/setup.mjs` | `setup` output: `schema/SETUP.md` playbook + inventory generated from the installed toolkit. On an already-configured `cwd`, injects a "Current configuration — update mode" section (live targets/stacks/includes/ejects/effective config/unset required keys/opt-in syrup state) so a re-run curates an update pass. |
| `installer/lib/migrations.mjs` | Migration registry (`MIGRATIONS`) + runner: ordered, idempotent, version-keyed steps `{ version, description, run(cwd) }`; applies steps in `(fromVersion, toVersion]`. Ships the 0.6.0 `.wafflestack.*`→`.waffle.*` rename, the 0.8.0 root→`.waffle/` config move, and the 0.10.0 consumer `bundles:`→`stacks:` key rename (#59). |
| `installer/lib/upgrade.mjs` | `upgrade` flow: lock-vs-toolkit version diff, `CHANGELOG.md` delta printout, run migrations, then render (`refreshSources: true` — re-fetch each git pin so a moved ref is observed) + doctor. Diffs re-resolved source commits against the lock to report per-source moves (`diffSources`, #125). Also exports the changelog-section parser. |
| `installer/lib/waffledocs.mjs` | Generate the `.waffle/` overview docs from the render selection: `CHEATSHEET.md` (user-invocable skills) + `TEAM.md` (installed agents), each with a branded, self-contained HTML page (`cheatsheet.html`/`team.html`; hybrid font strategy — Google Fonts link + system-font fallback, fonts the only external ref); plus a static `avatars/<agent>.svg` per agent and the `AVATARS.md` Gravatar-registration manifest (#157), whose per-agent commit emails are derived by `extractBaseEmail`/`deriveAgentEmail` **in lockstep with the delegate skill's prose rules**. Assembles from item frontmatter (skill `user-invocable`/`argument-hint`/`description`; agent `name`/`description`/`skills`/`identity`), substituted with render's resolver. Emitted via `render.mjs`'s `emit()`, so lock-tracked + doctor-checked + pruned. |
| `installer/lib/evals.mjs` | Layer 2 eval harness (#109): discover/validate `stacks/*/evals/*.eval.yaml` cases, render a case's target through `renderProject` into a temp project (rendered body → system prompt), drive a model, evaluate transcript assertions (`includes`/`excludes`/`regex` deterministic; `judge` LLM-graded). `Budget` enforces a hard call cap BEFORE each call (`BudgetExceededError` stops the run, remaining cases skipped). `anthropicClient` (fetch-based, no SDK dep) for live runs; `mockClient` for dry-run/tests. Driven by `installer/evals.mjs` (`npm run evals`), never by `npm test`. |
| `installer/lib/list.mjs` | `list` command (#119): compose `loadToolkit`/`loadProjectConfig`/`computeSelection`/`readLock`/doctor-style sha256 into a per-stack per-item state model classifying each item `current`/`outdated`/`not-installed`; render it as a plain aligned agent-parseable table (default, TTY-gated ANSI) or drive a hand-rolled keypress multi-select (`--interactive`, needs a real TTY, applies via `installRefs`+render). Built-in surface only (external `source:` stacks list as a selection error, like `setup`). |
| `installer/lib/prerequisites.mjs` | Typed external prerequisites (#47/#129): normalize a stack's `prerequisites:` list, scope it to a selection (`applicablePrerequisites`, like `requires:`), run each `check` shell command (`runCheck`, exit 0 = satisfied, stdio ignored, timeout-bounded) and bucket by level (`evaluatePrerequisites` → `{unmetRequired,unmetRecommended,met}`). `RENDER_PROBE_KINDS` = `{tool,env}` (the cheap kinds render probes; doctor probes all). Imported by `doctor.mjs` + `render.mjs`. |
| `installer/lib/sources.mjs` | External `source:` resolution (#88/#125): turn a `{name,source,sourceType,ref}` entry into a local toolkit root — a local path read in place, or a git URL fetched at the pinned `ref` into a content-addressed cache (reused unless `refresh`), returning `{root,commit}` for lock provenance. Rejects a leading-`-` git source/ref (argument-injection guard, belt-and-braces with the `--` end-of-options marker). `gitFetch`/`gitResolveCommit` injectable for hermetic tests. |

## CLI command registry

Bin `wafflestack` → `installer/cli.mjs`. Global flag `--cwd DIR` targets a project dir
(spliced out before ref parsing; default: process cwd; `cli.mjs:26`, `extractCwd` `cli.mjs:190`).
`render`/`install` also take `--force` (`extractFlag`, `cli.mjs:199`) to override the overwrite guard.
Usage: `wafflestack <init|setup|list|install|render|upgrade|doctor|eject|validate> [refs…] [--cwd DIR]`.

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `init` | Write starter `.waffle/waffle.yaml` (targets / stacks / include / config / eject scaffold, creating `.waffle/`); errors if one exists at any generation. `--gitignore` also appends `.waffle/waffle.local.yaml` (only that — no stack chosen yet). `eject.mjs:167` |
| `setup` | Print `schema/SETUP.md` playbook + inventory generated from the installed toolkit; when `--cwd` (or the invoked repo) is already configured, also prints a live "Current configuration — update mode" section. `setup.mjs:25` |
| `list` | Report the whole toolkit surface per stack/item vs. what this repo has installed (`installed & current` / `out of date` / `not installed`) as an aligned plain table (default — agent/CI-safe; ANSI only on a TTY, `--no-color` opts out). `--interactive` (real TTY both ends) drives a keypress multi-select that installs/updates the chosen refs then renders; degrades to the table without a TTY. Takes no refs. `list.mjs`, `cli.mjs:113` |
| `install [ref…]` | Persist each ref to config (stack → `stacks:`, item → canonical `include:`; resolves up front, reports pulled-in deps), then render. Bare `install` = `render`. `--force` overrides the overwrite guard; `--gitignore` appends recommended entries after a clean render. `eject.mjs:86` |
| `render` | Regenerate all managed files verbatim for the current selection; delete now-unrendered managed files; write lock. Rejects positional refs. Refuses to overwrite a pre-existing file not tracked by the lock unless `--force` (guard `render.mjs:245`). Exit 1 on error. `--gitignore` appends recommended entries after a clean render (`ensureGitignoreEntries` + `recommendedGitignoreEntries`, `offerGitignore` in `cli.mjs`). `render.mjs:33` |
| `upgrade` | Read lock `toolkitVersion`, print `CHANGELOG.md` delta to the invoked version, run migrations in `(from, to]`, then render (re-fetching external source pins, reporting per-source commit moves) + doctor. Missing lock/version degrades to render + doctor with a note. Rejects positional refs. Exit follows doctor. `upgrade.mjs:33` |
| `doctor` | Diff managed files vs lock; always report the rendered `toolkitVersion` + a skew note; run the selected stacks' typed `prerequisites:` checks. Exit 1 on drift OR an unmet `require`-level prerequisite (`recommend` only reports; `--allow-missing`: only modified files count as drift). `doctor.mjs:39` |
| `eject <skills/NAME\|agents/NAME\|files/PATH>` | Add to `eject:`, strip any matching `include:` entry, drop the item's files from the lock; files stay in place, now project-owned. `eject.mjs:24` |
| `validate` | Toolkit-developer lint: manifests parse, frontmatter complete, placeholder↔declaration sync, agent-skill/`requires:` refs resolve, `prerequisites:` fields + `items:` refs, harness.* defaults match their guards. Exit 1 on problems. `validate.mjs:11` |

## Item refs and render selection

A ref (used by `install`, `include:`, `eject`, and `requires:`) names something installable.
Grammar + resolution live in `refs.mjs` (`parseRef` `refs.mjs:64`, `resolveRef` `refs.mjs:91`).
The item kind is one of `agents`, `skills`, `files` (a `files/` payload — a workflow or script
byte/text-copied to that repo-relative path).

| Form | Example | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| stack | `github-workflow` | a whole stack (unknown name → error) |
| item | `skills/issue`, `agents/project-manager`, `files/.github/workflows/waffle-hygiene.yml` | an item; unqualified, must be unique toolkit-wide |
| qualified | `engineering-team/skills/webapp-security-audit` | an item in a named stack (disambiguates cross-stack name collisions) |

A bare item name resolves only when unique across the toolkit; otherwise it must be
stack-qualified. `canonicalRef` is the minimal re-resolvable form (qualified only when
ambiguous) — that is what `install` writes to `include:`.

Render selection (`computeSelection`, `refs.mjs:252`):

```
rendered = union(items of enabled stacks:) ∪ closure(each include: item) − eject:
```

- Opt-in syrup gate — a stack's `optIn:` `files/` items are excluded from default expansion
  unless the path is already lock-tracked (`trackedFiles`, from the prior lock via
  `renderProject`) or explicitly `include:`-ed (`refs.mjs:268`) — an existing install keeps
  updating, a fresh enable never silently arms a sensitive workflow. When a gated opt-in syrup
  file's `requires:` companion IS in the selection (its skill is rendering), `render`/`install`
  emits a warning naming the file + the exact `wafflestack install files/<path>` pour command
  (`skippedSyrupCompanions`, `refs.mjs`) — the non-interactive stand-in for the both/one/neither
  question `schema/SETUP.md` step 2 requires an agent to ask (#74). Warn-only by design; the CLI
  stays non-interactive.
- Dependency closure — installing an item pulls its transitive cross-stack deps (BFS, deduped
  by stack+kind+name). Direct deps of a node = agent frontmatter `skills:` (lenient — absent
  or ambiguous names skipped) + stack `requires:[kind/name]` (strict — a dangling entry is a
  toolkit bug). The closure is recomputed every render, never persisted.
- Grouping — selected items are grouped by owning stack; config/env checks run per stack over
  only the selected items. Required-config is scoped to placeholder keys the selected items
  reference (`missingRequiredKeys` `usedKeys`), so a partial install does not demand config only
  a stack's other items use. Env prerequisites still warn when any item from a stack renders.
- `eject:` wins over both `stacks:` and `include:`; `eject` self-cleans a matching `include:`.

## External stack sources

A `stacks:` entry is either a bare built-in name or a `{ name, source, ref }` mapping naming a
third-party source (#88). Parsed by `normalizeStackEntries` (`project.mjs`), resolved at render by
`loadToolkitWithSources` → `resolveSource` (`sources.mjs`). Authoring guide:
`schema/AUTHORING-EXTERNAL-STACKS.md`.

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `name` | required; unique across ALL `stacks:` entries (built-in + external); a collision is a hard error naming both sources |
| `source` | required; a git URL (`https://`, `ssh://`, `git@host:owner/repo`, `*.git`) or a local filesystem path (`classifyStackSource`) |
| `ref` | git source: REQUIRED (tag/branch/commit); local path: MUST be omitted |

- Resolution — a git source is fetched at the pinned `ref` into a content-addressed cache, reused
  unless `refresh`; a local path is read in place. `name` selects `stacks/<name>/` (toolkit-root
  source) or a root `stack.yaml` (single-stack source).
- Security — a git `source`/`ref` beginning with `-` is rejected (argument-injection guard),
  belt-and-braces with the `--` end-of-options marker at the git exec site.
- Provenance — external files are recorded in the lock `sources` block (`{ name, source,
  sourceType, ref, commit, files }`); `doctor` attributes drift per source, `upgrade` re-resolves
  each pin and reports commit moves (`diffSources`).
- Trust boundary — `render` lint-validates every external stack before writing a byte (#126,
  `validateExternalStacks`) and emits an extra acknowledgement warning when external opt-in syrup
  is poured.

## Stack prerequisites

Typed external prerequisites (#129) — the environment things a copy-in install can neither provide
nor verify (distinct from `requires:`, which maps render-closure edges between waffles). Schema
(`prerequisites.mjs`; kinds `PREREQ_KINDS`, levels `PREREQ_LEVELS`):

```yaml
prerequisites:
  - kind: tool           # tool|secret|scope|label|setting|service|env
    name: gh
    level: require       # require (fails doctor) | recommend (reports only)
    check: command -v gh # deterministic shell command; exit 0 = satisfied
    items: [skills/issue] # optional: scope to specific waffles (like requires:); omit = stack-wide
    description: …
```

- Scope — `applicablePrerequisites` limits entries to the selected items, like `requires:`.
- Doctor gate — `doctor` runs every applicable `check`; an unmet `require` fails (exit 1, so the
  shipped `waffle-doctor` CI job verifies it), a `recommend` only reports. Surfaced in `setup`
  inventory and `schema/SETUP.md`.
- Render — only the cheap `RENDER_PROBE_KINDS` (`tool`/`env`) are probed at render as non-blocking
  warnings; the network/auth kinds (secret/scope/label/setting/service) are left to the `doctor` gate.
- The legacy `env:` map is subsumed as the `env` kind, read-compatibly (both may coexist).

## Template semantics

- Placeholders `{{dotted.key}}` (regex `/(?<!\$)\{\{\s*([A-Za-z][\w.-]*)\s*\}\}/g`,
  `template.mjs:7`) substitute only if the key is declared in the stack's `config:` or is
  `harness.*` (`template.mjs:38`). Any other braces (bash `${...}`, mustache) pass through
  verbatim; a `$`-prefixed `${{ }}` (GitHub Actions) is hard-excluded by the negative
  lookbehind, so `files/` workflow payloads carry those expressions untouched and unpoliced.
- Value formatting (`formatValue`, `template.mjs:67`): strings verbatim; string arrays join
  `, `; other structures render as a YAML block.
- `harness.*` — reserved, always-available namespace (never declared), resolved per output
  target (`HARNESS_BUILTINS`, `project.mjs:386`). Override via `config.harness.<sub>` (scalar →
  all targets, or a per-target map). Also carries three target-independent CI-dispatcher scalars
  (`actionRef`/`actionVersion`/`apiKeySecret`, #131) spliced into the rendered workflow `uses:` /
  `with:` lines; each is injection-guarded at render by `HARNESS_PATTERNS` (rejects `${{`, quotes,
  newlines), so an override can repin/repoint the action without ejecting the workflow.
- Nested substitution — substituted values are re-expanded up to depth 4
  (`MAX_SUBSTITUTION_DEPTH`, `template.mjs:15`; `expandNested`, `template.mjs:59`): a committed
  value can reference a key kept in the gitignored local overlay. Canonical text surviving the
  first pass is never re-scanned; unresolvable nested placeholders pass through.
- Value patterns — a config key may declare `pattern:` (a regex); the fully-resolved value must
  fully match at render or the render fails like a missing required key (`compilePattern`
  `template.mjs`, enforced in `substitute`, linted by `validate`) — for values spliced into
  structured contexts (a workflow `if:`, a YAML scalar) where escaping is impossible.
- Extensions — `.waffle/extensions/{agents,skills}/<name>.md` appended to the rendered
  item inside `<!-- BEGIN project extension: … -->` / `<!-- END project extension -->` markers
  (`appendExtension`, `render.mjs:419`). Agents: appended to body; skills: appended to
  `SKILL.md` only.
- Output conflict — two enabled sources emitting the same output path is a hard render error
  (`emit`, `render.mjs:100`), not last-write-wins.
- Unmanaged-file overwrite guard — a render that would produce a path already on disk but not
  tracked by the previous lock (a consumer's hand-written file) is refused before any write or
  prune, leaving the tree untouched (`render.mjs:245`); a byte-identical file is adopted
  silently. `--force` overwrites.

| `harness.*` key | claude | codex | agents-dir |
|-----------------|--------|-------|------------|
| `harness.assistantName` | Claude | Codex | Codex |
| `harness.attributionPath` | claude-code | Codex | Codex |
| `harness.skillsDir` | .claude/skills | .agents/skills | .agents/skills |

Target-independent CI-dispatcher scalars (#131; same value on every target):

| `harness.*` key | default |
|-----------------|---------|
| `harness.actionRef` | `anthropics/claude-code-action` |
| `harness.actionVersion` | current pinned SHA + preserved `# vX.Y.Z` comment |
| `harness.apiKeySecret` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

Render targets (`VALID_TARGETS`, `project.mjs:27`):

| Source | claude | codex | agents-dir |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| agent `agents/<n>.md` | `.claude/agents/<n>.md` (frontmatter name/description/skills + `claude:` passthrough; body) | `.codex/agents/<n>.toml` (name, description, developer_instructions=body) | `.agents/agents/<n>.md` (neutral Markdown: frontmatter name/description/skills, no `claude:` passthrough; body) |
| skill `skills/<n>/` | `.claude/skills/<n>/` | `.agents/skills/<n>/` | `.agents/skills/<n>/` |

Full matrix — every target renders both kinds (#94). codex + agents-dir share the cross-tool
`.agents/skills/<n>/` skill dir (Codex scans `.agents/skills` cwd→repo-root, matching
`harness.skillsDir`); `renderSkill` dedupes it by output dir (first target wins) so enabling
both writes it once. Skills render byte-for-byte except substitution + extension append;
non-`.md` supporting files are copied verbatim.

## Consuming-project contract

Everything lives inside the one `.waffle/` directory (0.8.0 layout; legacy root `.waffle.*`
and pre-0.6.0 `.wafflestack.*` names still read with a deprecation note and are moved in
place by `render`/`upgrade`):

| File | Tracked | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| `.waffle/waffle.yaml` | committed | version, `targets`, `stacks` (bare built-in names or `{name,source,ref}` external mappings), `include`, `config`, `eject` (`loadProjectConfig`, `project.mjs:212`). `install`/`eject` edit it comment-preservingly. |
| `.waffle/waffle.local.yaml` | gitignored | deep-merged over committed config, wins on conflict — account-specific values |
| `.waffle/extensions/{agents,skills}/<name>.md` | committed | appended to the rendered item inside extension markers |
| `.waffle/waffle.lock.json` | generated | manifest of rendered file → sha256 (+ toolkitVersion, targets, stacks, include, and an optional `sources` provenance block for external stacks, #125); `doctor` diffs against it, `render` rewrites it |
| `.waffle/{CHEATSHEET,TEAM}.md` + `.waffle/{cheatsheet,team}.html` | generated (committed by consumers) | overview of the installed selection — cheat sheet of user-invocable skills + team intro of agents, Markdown source of truth + branded self-contained HTML (hybrid font strategy: Google Fonts link + system fallback). Emitted via `emit()` (`waffledocs.mjs`), so lock-tracked, doctor-checked, and pruned like any managed file |
| `.waffle/AVATARS.md` + `.waffle/avatars/<agent>.svg` | generated (committed by consumers) | one static, deterministic waffle SVG per installed agent, plus the manifest pairing each with its exact derived commit email and the manual Gravatar-registration procedure that makes GitHub render it on commit views (#157). Same `emit()` lifecycle |

## Build / test / verify

Node >= 18. Single runtime dependency: `yaml`.

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| test | `npm test` (node:test, `installer/test/*.test.mjs`; 363 tests, 62 suites) |
| validate / typecheck | `npm run validate` = `node installer/cli.mjs validate` |
| build | `npm pack --dry-run` |
| render (dogfood) | `node installer/cli.mjs render` |
| verify render | `node installer/cli.mjs doctor` |
| evals (metered, LLM tier — #109) | `npm run evals -- --max-calls N` (live, needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) / `npm run evals -- --dry-run` (mock, free). 8 cases across `github-workflow` (6) + `orchestration` (2); scheduled nightly by the opt-in `waffle-evals` syrup. **Not** in `npm test`. |

Test files: `installer.test.mjs` (render pipeline machinery), `checkpoint.test.mjs` /
`memory.test.mjs` (the delegate skill's shipped validator CLIs), `content.test.mjs`
(eval layer 1, #108: deterministic key-phrase assertions on rendered stack prompts —
reads the committed `.claude/skills/**` render, renders the gitignored label-hook workflow
to a temp dir; pins load-bearing guardrails so rewording passes but removing one fails CI),
`evals.test.mjs` (eval layer 2 harness, #109: discovery/validation, target render, assertion
+ budget logic, and a dry-run over the shipped seed case — all with the mock model, so it runs
free inside `npm test`; the metered runner itself is `npm run evals`, never `npm test`).

## Dogfood state

This repo renders 5 stacks into itself — `github-workflow`, `docs-system`, `orchestration`,
`harness-architect`, `wafflestack` (`targets: [claude]`, plus `include:` refs arming three opt-in
syrup workflows — `files/.github/workflows/waffle-hygiene.yml`, `.../waffle-release-hook.yml`,
`.../waffle-pr-green-hook.yml` — and the qualified `code-quality/skills/adversarial-review` the
PR-green hook runs plus `code-quality/skills/qa` for autopilot's opt-in QA gate;
`.waffle/waffle.yaml`). The render (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`,
`.claude/settings.json`) and `.waffle/waffle.lock.json` are COMMITTED — like a consuming
project — because the CI hygiene harness reads the committed skills and the doctor drift gate
(required check on main) needs render + lock in git. Re-render AND commit after editing
`stacks/**`. Gitignored: `.claude/worktrees/` (throwaway), `.codex/`/`.agents/` (non-targets),
`.github/workflows/waffle-label-hook.yml` (would arm a live label→harness dispatch), and the
generated `.waffle/` overview docs (`CHEATSHEET.md`, `TEAM.md`, `cheatsheet.html`, `team.html`) —
these deliberate absences are tolerated by doctor's `--allow-missing`.

## Owner-voiced docs — do not rewrite

`README.md`, `schema/FORMAT.md`, and `schema/SETUP.md` are owner-voiced canonical documents
(the schema files ship to consumers via npx). Do not rewrite them in a docs pass — flag any
drift instead.
