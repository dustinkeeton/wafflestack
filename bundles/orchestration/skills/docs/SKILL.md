description: Orchestrates documentation updates by spawning architect, docs-agent, and docs-human agents in sequence. Architect audits the codebase and communicates changes, docs-agent writes machine-readable docs, docs-human writes human-readable docs.

# Documentation Orchestration

When this skill is invoked, run the following pipeline:

## Step 1: Architect Audit

Spawn the `architect` agent with this prompt:

> Audit the current codebase for any architectural changes since the docs were last updated. Read the existing AGENTS.md files and compare against the actual code. Produce a concise **change report** covering:
> - New or removed modules, files, commands, settings
> - Changed public APIs or type signatures
> - Dependency changes between modules
> - Any architectural violations or inconsistencies
>
> Output ONLY the change report as structured text. Do not modify any files.

## Step 2: Agent Documentation

Take the architect's change report and spawn the `docs-agent` agent with this prompt:

> Here is the architect's change report for the {{project.name}} codebase:
>
> {architect's output}
>
> Update all AGENTS.md files (root and per-feature in src/) to reflect the current state of the codebase. Read the actual source files to verify details — do not rely solely on the change report. Follow the docs-agent skill guidelines for format and structure.

## Step 3: Human Documentation

After docs-agent completes, spawn the `docs-human` agent with this prompt:

> The agent documentation (AGENTS.md files) has just been updated. Update the human-facing documentation:
> - DECISIONS.md — add entries for any new decisions reflected in code changes
> - STATUS.md — update to reflect current project state
> - ARCHITECTURE.md — update if architecture has changed
>
> Read the updated AGENTS.md files and the actual source code to ensure accuracy. Follow the docs-human skill guidelines for format and structure.

## Important

- Each step must complete before the next begins — the output of each informs the next.
- The architect agent should NOT modify files — it only reports.
- docs-agent and docs-human SHOULD modify their respective documentation files.

## Why No Teams

This skill intentionally does **not** use agent teams. The 3-step pipeline (architect → docs-agent → docs-human) is strictly sequential — each step's output is the next step's input. There is no parallelism to exploit, so team coordination overhead would add complexity with no benefit. If this pipeline gains a parallel step in the future, reconsider.
